# Dreameater Games Asset Museum
## Description:
This is a collection of original content made by David Croshaw, the project lead for Rizzo Island, and founder of Dreameater Games. 
All this stuff was used to gain knowledge into the Quake engine and what it could handle. As such,
most of it is not production ready at all, and some of the maps are missing textures, and bsp optimizations. Not even sure if some of the major ones are "leak proof." You are free to do what you want with them as long as they are under the BSD2 license agreement. You can see how to credit below.<br>
